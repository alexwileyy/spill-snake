## The test

Your job is to recreate the classic snake game. You are not expected to complete this in the time provided. It is purely a test to see how you work through problems.

Some things have been made for you...

- the board is a div that is split into rows and columns using css grid
- a snake cell has been made that takes a grid column and row as attrs (not rendered yet)
- a food cell has been made that take a grid column and row as attrs (not rendered yet)

We will have an 45 mins to work through the problem with 15 mins to review at the end.

We suggest you take some time at the start to read the code and ask questions. Use pen/paper or a whiteboard to plan out your solution.
